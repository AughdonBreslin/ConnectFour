ConnectFour AI

Welcome!

This is my Connect Four algorithm from my 'Advanced Topics in Computer Science' course in highschool. The AI creates fake boards and plays out and evaluated games into the future to see which path would result in the best outcome. It uses the principle of minimaxing, mini for minimizing the possible loss by simulating the opponents best moves, and max for maximizing its own winning chances. 

While the scoring is not refined according to Connect Four theory, it provides a very good intuitive approximation of what a good board would look like! At depths of 5 and higher, the AI becomes very difficult to beat as it can find the best move really far into the future.

ConnectFourAI is also my very first go at creating an artificial connect four opponent, and I am very pleased with how it came out! It started as a curiosity project (as was the point of the Advanced Topics class, pick something cool and try to make it happen), and it blossomed into a project that my CS teacher at the time, Daryl Detrick, used in a county-wide Computer Science showcase, as well as using it as a challenger to beat in a school fundraiser.
